## Abstract

Team members commonly collaborate on visual documents remotely and asynchronously. Particularly, students are frequently restricted to this setting as they often do not share work schedules or physical workspaces. As communication in this setting has delays and limits the main modality to text, members exert more effort to reference document objects and understand others' intentions. We propose <span style="color:{{site.syscolor}}">**Winder**</span>, a Figma plugin that addresses these challenges through *linked tapes*&mdash;multimodal comments of clicks and voice. Bidirectional links between the clicked-on objects and voice recordings facilitate understanding tapes: selecting objects retrieves relevant recordings, and playing recordings highlights related objects. By periodically prompting users to produce tapes, <span style="color:{{site.syscolor}}">**Winder**</span> preemptively obtains information to satisfy potential communication needs. Through a five-day study with eight teams of three, we evaluated the system's impact on teams asynchronously designing graphical user interfaces. Our findings revealed that producing linked tapes could be as lightweight as face-to-face (F2F) interactions while transmitting intentions more precisely than text. Furthermore, with preempted tapes, teammates coordinated tasks and invited members to build on each others' work.

## System

<span style="color:{{site.syscolor}}">**Winder**</span> supports three features for tape understanding and navigation: (a) highlighting objects on playback of voice recordings, (b) inline thumbnail images of objects on automatic transcripts, and (c) search of recordings based on objects.
